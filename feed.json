				"title": "On Scribble on iPadOS 14",
				"content_html": "<p>Yesterday I downloaded iPadOS 14 and wanted to test the new Scribble-feature that converts handwritten text to, you know, text. And so I&rsquo;m writing this post (mostly) using my Apple Pencil and I have to admit that I&rsquo;m a bit impressed. It works pretty well-ish. So far I&rsquo;ve used an app called <a href=\"https://www.goodnotes.com\">Good Notes</a> to take handwritten notes, but there was no way to use the Pencil to enter text into textfields.</p>\n<p>Although it&rsquo;s nice at first glance, I&rsquo;m annoyed by a couple of things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The screen that introduces this feature is a mix of German and English as you can see in the screenshot I attached. I use my iPad in German and this might look like a minor detail, but to me, this is an important one. In my mind either nobody cared or QA failed and both cases make me a bit sad. Hopefully this feature is available for German, too. I will test it immediately 🤓\n<img src=\"https://zeitschlag.micro.blog/uploads/2020/d3d5788f93.jpg\" alt=\"\"></li>\n<li>The second thing is that the underlying machine learning doesn&rsquo;t recognize some characters correctly or at all, yet. <em>1</em> and <em>I</em> are just one example, special characters are another. Maybe this improves over time?</li>\n<li>When something goes wrong, like when a typo appears or so, I don&rsquo;t know how to fix the error easily using the Pencil. I know that I can strike a word or whole paragraph to remove it but when it comes to changing just one letter, using the keyboard is far more convenient — and faster. Sometimes the text gets selected instead of being removed, this is another annoyance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In conclusion I&rsquo;d really like to like Scribble and maybe I should just give it a chance? If it fails the test of time I still can go back to my beloved keyboard.</p>\n<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I just found out, that English and Mandarin are the only supported languages at the moment. Hopefully this changes in the near future as I really like this feature! Reading a book and scribbling notes in there is just great!</p>\n",
				"content_text": "Yesterday I downloaded iPadOS 14 and wanted to test the new Scribble-feature that converts handwritten text to, you know, text. And so I'm writing this post (mostly) using my Apple Pencil and I have to admit that I'm a bit impressed. It works pretty well-ish. So far I've used an app called [Good Notes](https://www.goodnotes.com) to take handwritten notes, but there was no way to use the Pencil to enter text into textfields.\n\nAlthough it's nice at first glance, I'm annoyed by a couple of things:\n\n- The screen that introduces this feature is a mix of German and English as you can see in the screenshot I attached. I use my iPad in German and this might look like a minor detail, but to me, this is an important one. In my mind either nobody cared or QA failed and both cases make me a bit sad. Hopefully this feature is available for German, too. I will test it immediately 🤓\n![](https://zeitschlag.micro.blog/uploads/2020/d3d5788f93.jpg)\n- The second thing is that the underlying machine learning doesn't recognize some characters correctly or at all, yet. *1* and *I* are just one example, special characters are another. Maybe this improves over time?\n- When something goes wrong, like when a typo appears or so, I don't know how to fix the error easily using the Pencil. I know that I can strike a word or whole paragraph to remove it but when it comes to changing just one letter, using the keyboard is far more convenient — and faster. Sometimes the text gets selected instead of being removed, this is another annoyance.\n\nIn conclusion I'd really like to like Scribble and maybe I should just give it a chance? If it fails the test of time I still can go back to my beloved keyboard.\n\n**Edit**: I just found out, that English and Mandarin are the only supported languages at the moment. Hopefully this changes in the near future as I really like this feature! Reading a book and scribbling notes in there is just great!\n",
