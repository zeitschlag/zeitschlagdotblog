			 <p>Ein bisschen lustig finde ich es ja schon, wie Reichen und Unternehmen der Arsch wegen <a href="https://www.dwenteignen.de">#dwenteignen</a> auf Grundeis geht. Und es kommen mantrahaft immer wieder die gleichen Bullshit-Aussagen:</p>
<ul>
<li>„Enteignen schafft keine einzige neue Wohnung“ (No Shit, Sherlock),</li>
<li>„Berlin ist auf Jahre überschuldet“ (Ihr habt euch nicht angeschaut, <em>wie</em> das finanziert werden soll, ne?)</li>
<li>„Der Markt wird das schon richten! MEHR NEUBAU!!!! WENIGER BÜROKRATIE!!!!!“ (Jo, und wer soll sich den dann leisten können?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Gerade beim letzten Punkt wird es interessant — da hatte ich gestern ein <a href="https://www.gls.de/privatkunden/deutsche-wohnen/">schönes Video bei der GLS-Bank</a> gesehen: Boden (und somit indirekt auch Wohnraum) sind im Grunde genommen gar keine handelbare Ware, weil er begrenzt ist. Mit anderen Worten: Der Marktmechanismus mit Angebot und Nachfrage und dem daraus resultierenden Preis funktioniert bei Boden gar nicht. Der Markt kann es also gar nicht richten, weil es kein Markt ist ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>Schön — und richtig! — finde ich den Schluss, den Thomas Jorberg von der GLS-Bank in dem kleinen Filmchen aufmacht: Wir müssen Wohnraum dem „Marktgeschehen“ entziehen und Wohnraum bzw. das Nutzungsrecht (Wohnen) in Genossenschaften oder gemeinnütziger Form weiterführen. Und das ist ja genau das, was die Kampagne #dwenteignen will! So, und jetzt lasst uns Vonovia und Co. ✨vergesellschaften✨ ✊💜💛</p>

			 <p>For the first time in ages I went to a concert yesterday. It was outdoors, of course. There were <a href="https://www.digitalinberlin.de/kiezsalon-gardens-of-the-world-2021/">four great musicians</a> performing in the “Gardens of the World”-park in Berlin, one of them being <a href="http://aliciaedelweiss.com/">Alicia Edelweiss</a> whose album I bought <a href="https://zeitschlag.blog/2020/10/27/155553.html">more than one year ago</a>.

			 <p>As this seems to be my food blog and poor man’s instagram, this is <em>the</em> place to mention this: For the last couple of weeks I’ve had a huge craving for instant noodles. You know, these cheap convenience food packages from the Asian grocery store around the corner. Tonight’s dinner will be the DIY-version of that, kind of. Without this artificial seasoning and stuff. But with a truckload of instant noodles, of course.</p>

			 <p>In 2006 I bought my first CD ever: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stadium_Arcadium">Stadium Arcadium</a> by Red Hot Chili Peppers. A few years later, the Internet did its thing and I stopped paying for music for several years. Around 2012 or so I started using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotify">Spotify</a> and had it since then with some years of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Music">Apple Music</a> in between. Over all those years I discovered lots of great artists and listened to a huge number of songs, a lot of them are connected to people the once were or still are part of my life.</p>
<p>Six months ago, I heard a song by Austrian musician <a href="http://aliciaedelweiss.com">Alicia Edelweiss</a> and <a href="https://aliciaedelweiss.bandcamp.com">bought the whole album</a> instantly. You have to support artists during the pandemic, I told myself.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>A few days ago I cancelled my Spotify-subscription. There are several reasons for this step:</p>
<ul>
<li>From what I&rsquo;ve heard, music streaming is a pretty bad deal for artists in general. You have to support artists, especially now. This might be more expensive, but I hope, that the music will be worth it, literally.</li>
<li>It feels like that I&rsquo;ve listened to way too much music during the last years. Music became a background noise, I mostly listen to it during the day, during work. And while having access to music anytime is great, I somehow lost connection to the music itself, it&rsquo;s nothing special anymore. I want to know the music, value its details, enjoy it consciensly, dance to it, make it something special.</li>
<li>I want to own my music. I want to have a CD I can share with friends, for example, even if I&rsquo;m broke.</li>
</ul>
<p>And now you have to excuse me. There&rsquo;s some music that needs my attention. Or is it me needing the music&rsquo;s attention? Does it matter?</p>

			 <p>Usually I use my iPad to read RSS feeds or comic books or watch movies. Since a few days I&rsquo;m reading the probably most famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_Years">book by anthropologist David Graeber</a>. I really enjoy it and for the first time I take notes in the exact same book using Apple Pencil. While I read the book in German, I write my notes in English so that I can <a href="https://zeitschlag.blog/2020/09/18/on-scribble-on.html">scribble</a> them. Taking notes this way is really fun!</p>
<p>Back in school teacher always told us that you didn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> read a book unless you wrote notes in it or marked the most important or interesting parts.</p>
<p>Oh, the book is also interesting to read, although sometimes it feels quite academic and I&rsquo;m not used to this at all.</p>

<p>Today I went to a local store called <em><a href="https://www.getraenkefeinkost.de">Getränkefeinkost</a></em> which was recommended to me by a former guest of the podcast. It&rsquo;s a delicatessen store for beverages — craft beer, special lemonades and so on.

			 <p>I&rsquo;m struggeling with the new Sleep Schedule in iOS 14. I&rsquo;m wearing my Watch to track my sleep, but I want the alarm to go off on my iPhone so that I have to stand up to disable it. This was possible prior to iOS 14, but now it looks like that I must rely on the Watch for alarms when using the Sleep Schedule. This sucks, seriously.</p>

<p>Thankfully the Clock-app is still there so tomorrow I will try again not to oversleep.</p>
<p>Does any of you know how to use this Sleep-thing with a Watch, but with alarms going off on an iPhone?</p>

			<h1><a href="https://zeitschlag.micro.blog/2020/09/18/on-scribble-on.html">On Scribble on iPadOS 14</a></h1>
		

		<a href="https://zeitschlag.micro.blog/2020/09/18/on-scribble-on.html" class="u-url"><time class="dt-published" datetime="2020-09-18 11:29:00 &#43;0200">Sep 18, 2020</time></a>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Yesterday I downloaded iPadOS 14 and wanted to test the new Scribble-feature that converts handwritten text to, you know, text. And so I&rsquo;m writing this post (mostly) using my Apple Pencil and I have to admit that I&rsquo;m a bit impressed. It works pretty well-ish. So far I&rsquo;ve used an app called <a href="https://www.goodnotes.com">Good Notes</a> to take handwritten notes, but there was no way to use the Pencil to enter text into textfields.</p>
<p>Although it&rsquo;s nice at first glance, I&rsquo;m annoyed by a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The screen that introduces this feature is a mix of German and English as you can see in the screenshot I attached. I use my iPad in German and this might look like a minor detail, but to me, this is an important one. In my mind either nobody cared or QA failed and both cases make me a bit sad. Hopefully this feature is available for German, too. I will test it immediately 🤓
<img src="https://zeitschlag.micro.blog/uploads/2020/d3d5788f93.jpg" alt=""></li>
<li>The second thing is that the underlying machine learning doesn&rsquo;t recognize some characters correctly or at all, yet. <em>1</em> and <em>I</em> are just one example, special characters are another. Maybe this improves over time?</li>
<li>When something goes wrong, like when a typo appears or so, I don&rsquo;t know how to fix the error easily using the Pencil. I know that I can strike a word or whole paragraph to remove it but when it comes to changing just one letter, using the keyboard is far more convenient — and faster. Sometimes the text gets selected instead of being removed, this is another annoyance.</li>
</ul>
<p>In conclusion I&rsquo;d really like to like Scribble and maybe I should just give it a chance? If it fails the test of time I still can go back to my beloved keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I just found out, that English and Mandarin are the only supported languages at the moment. Hopefully this changes in the near future as I really like this feature! Reading a book and scribbling notes in there is just great!</p>

			 <p>Until a few weeks ago, I used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strava">Strava</a> to track my cycling and running. Seeing how far and how much I&rsquo;ve ran really motivates me. Yeah, those ads for the <a href="https://www.strava.com/subscribe">Strava Subscription</a> started getting on my nerves, but you know, giving kudos to friends and seeing some basic stats like the comparison among weeks made it worth nevertheless. Until a few weeks ago.</p>
<p>I imagine, that the investors told Strava to earn some more money, so they hired some growth hackers and then everything turned to shit. Those stats for example, how far I ran the past week? They&rsquo;re gone. I gotta pay for them now. Like monthly. That&rsquo;s a pitty, because to me, who runs once or twice a week, those stats are not worth more than like a buck or two.</p>
<p>Paying 60 bucks per year or 15 per month is way over the amount I&rsquo;m willing to pay, so: Sorry Strava, I moved on and started using <a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/aktivit%C3%A4t/id1208224953">Activity</a> with my Apple watch. There might be a small iOS-app incoming.</p>

Earlier this year I made a promise: I want to go there by bike. And so I did. I stayed at the flat of a friend and took care of their plants in exchange. On friday, I jumped on my bicycle and went off to the sea. After like 40 kilometers, I suffered from a flat tire in the middle of nowhere, but thankfully the parents of another very dear friend drove me back to the city. And so I spent the afternoon fixing my bike. On saturday, I even attended a small cruise for like 15 minutes. Then the ferry arrived at the final stop.</p>

<p>I use <a href="https://pedometer.app">Pedometer++ by _davidsmith</a> to count them and this 180 days streak is now pretty important to me, I don‘t want to break it. What I really like about this app is that it allows occasional cheating days: After six days in a row, you‘re allowed to not have those 10.000 steps for one day without ruining your streak.</p>
<p>Especially as I‘m working from home, this app has been even more important during <em>the</em> pandemic, as it makes me leave my flat at least once per day. Sometimes I still have to do some steps before going to bed, but this doesn‘t bother me at all. Doing so is easier than letting the streak break.</p>
<p>Going outside for a walk or a run nearly always brightens my day. I guess, this has become some kind of a habbit now.</p>

I didn&rsquo;t have a plan and so the last couple of days were actually pretty stressful to me. Due to the COVID—19 pandemic, time flies and this weekend just popped up out of nowhere.</p>
<p>Next week, I&rsquo;ll have to take an entire week of vacation and I&rsquo;m already thinking about what to do. I&rsquo;d like to have a plan, at least.</p>

			 <p>I just finished reading &ldquo;My Sister, the Serial Killer&rdquo;, the book by <a href="https://oyinkanbraithwaite.com">Oyinkan Braithwaite</a> which I bought <a href="https://zeitschlag.micro.blog/2020/06/11/yesterday-i-asked.html">two days ago</a> — and I enjoyed it. Lots of dark humor, not a lot of hope, some dead people, some unexpected turnarounds. Thanks a lot for the recommendation, it&rsquo;s a great book, I would buy — and read, obviously — again.</p>
<p>Reading it in English went far better than I expected.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I asked for recommendations of good book, a thriller, something like that. Today I went to a local bookstore and bought ”My Sister, the Serial Killer“ by Oyinkan Braithwaite.</p>
<p>It‘s been my first English novel for quite some time.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday, I wrote some code, but I didn&rsquo;t write any unit tests, like most of the time. I know, that this is a bad habbit and I want to get rid of it. So, first thing this morning: Writing some tests. What helped me was <a href="https://leanpub.com/tdd_ios_gimme_the_code">this book</a></p>
<p>And while doing so, I fixed two bugs and afterwards, a colleague of mine requested some minor refactorings. Thankfully, now that there were tests, it was a joy to change the code and not break anything.</p>
<p>The thing is: Whenever I write tests, I make some positive experiences from it pretty much right away. But when I write code the next time, I just don&rsquo;t write tests — again. I have no idea, why.</p>

			 <p>A few months ago I heard in the news, that the <a href="https://www.berliner-tafel.de/berliner-tafel/">local food bank</a> needed volunteers due to the COVID—19-pandemic. Elder people do most of the work there, and as they&rsquo;re prone to severly suffer from COVID—19, they had to pause their engagement. So I sent them an email and have helped them since then. Volunteering there has become a routine part of my weekend and I totally don&rsquo;t want to miss it. I&rsquo;ve meet some very friendly people there, you get some freshly cooked lunch and after a whole week of programming, it somehow feels like doing purposeful work: I&rsquo;m making myself useful. Oh, and every time you help there, you get sweets.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s shameful, that those instutions have to exist, but that&rsquo;s not the point here.</p>

			 <p>I suck at playing video games, I&rsquo;m like <em>really</em> bad. But some of them are just great, <a href="https://goose.game">The Untitled Goose Game</a>, for example. I bought it for the Nintendo Switch a few months ago and every once in a while I spent half an hour trying to solve some puzzles. Sometimes, I&rsquo;m successful, sometimes I&rsquo;m not, but I&rsquo;m still having a good time even when failing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, console games are so freacking expensive. <a href="https://apps.apple.com/en/app/stardew-valley/id1406710800">Stardew Valley for iOS</a> is five-ish bucks, while you have to pay three times the price for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/stardew-valley-switch/">Stardew Valley for Nintendo Switch</a>. But maybe prices for iOS apps are just broken?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/mario-kart-8-deluxe-switch/">most recent version of Mario Kart</a> is sold for 60 bucks — for one game! Who can afford that?</p>

			 <p>In Berlin, the town I live in, there&rsquo;re pretty strict lockdown-ish rules due to the pandemic.  I haven&rsquo;t physically met with neither my partners nor close friends for a few weeks now and to be honest: Next to going to the gym, this isolation is the most stressful part to me.</p>
<p>Nevertheless I&rsquo;m sitting in a park right now, enjoying the sun, physical-distancing myself from everyone else. The next people are several meters away, everyone is calm, but you can feel, that something is different. Something&rsquo;s in the air.</p>
<p>Spring and summer are the most amazing seasons in Berlin. Everyone is going out again, nature&rsquo;s turning green again, the weather&rsquo;s great most of the time, but you can feel, that this year, something will be different.</p>

			 <p>A few weeks ago, I startet to write an offline micro-blog. Some may call it a diary. You know, old-fashioned, unencrypted and handwritten. I bought a small, red notebook and started to write.</p>
<p>Around the same time I started meditating again. Two minutes a day, most days in the evening. And I found out, that medidating clears my mind: Whenever I meditate before writing a diary entry, it feels better and more structured than without meditating. It feels like self-care.</p>

			 <p>Yesterday I attended the Global Climate Strike in Berlin together with 270 000 other people. Throughout Germany, 1.4 million people attended that strike. But that exact same morning, the German government decided to do nothing against global warming again, but making life easier for rich people. They sell this &ldquo;do nothing&rdquo; decision as kind of &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Dear politicians, I&rsquo;m angry. I don&rsquo;t want you to lower taxes. I want you to fucking fight global warning. What can I buy for all the money in the world, when there&rsquo;s no world?</p>

			 <p>Here are some things I really like about micro.blog:</p>
<ul>
<li>I can write in Markdown.</li>
<li>There is a very low barrier to me: I can simply write down a thought or post an image. All I have to do is to start typing. I don&rsquo;t even have to enter a title.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t feel any pressure to perfect things. This is kind of new to me, although I&rsquo;ve written blogposts for ~13 years or so.</li>
